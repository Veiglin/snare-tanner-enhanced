    Use believable extensions like .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .db, .sql or .zip.
    Ensure all filenames look authentic and vary slightly each time.

  PROMPT-404-ERROR: >
    Write a short HTML bait line (in a <p> tag) that subtly hints at an internal file located at /{honeytoken}. 
    It should look like something a developer accidentally left in, referencing the file path naturally.
    Your goal is to lead a potential attacker to believe that this is a legitimate file path. 
  PROMPT-HTML-COMMENT: >
    Write a realistic one-line HTML comment like a developer's note.
    It should mention /{honeytoken} as if it's a config file or temporary log.
    Do NOT include HTML tags or '--'. Make it look like leftover debug info."
