  PROMPT-FILENAMES: >
    You are generating bait filenames for a website called SmartGadgetStore.live, which sells smart gadgets and electronics online.

    Examples include inventory backups, customer exports, admin data, supplier lists, or device configuration dumps.
    {session}
    Use only the file types .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .db, .sql or .zip and ensure there is minumum one .docx, one .xlsx and one .pdf file.
  PROMPT-DOCX: >
    Given the file name {honeytoken}, generate content for a realistic-looking internal document that would plausibly appear in a document with that name.
    The tone should match the filename — e.g., meeting notes, credentials, export summaries, or sensitive business context.
    The content should be for a smart gadget store. Make it {dynamic}.
    Do not explain your answer, just return the document's content.
  PROMPT-XLSX: >

    The content should be for a smart gadget store. Make it {dynamic}.

  PROMPT-404-ERROR: >
    Generate a single-line HTML <p> element that appears to be a leftover developer note or debug message.
    It should subtly mention a file path at /{honeytoken}.
    Keep it realistic and brief — like a developer accidentally left a comment in the HTML.
    Do not explain the line, just return the raw <p> tag.
  PROMPT-HTML-COMMENT: >
    Write a realistic one-line HTML comment like a developer's note.
    It should mention /{honeytoken} as if it's a config file or temporary log.
    Do NOT include HTML tags or '--'. Make it look like leftover debug info."
